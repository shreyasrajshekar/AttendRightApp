# 🎓 AttendRight  

Tired of playing **attendance calculator gymnastics** before every class?  
AttendRight is here so you can bunk without stress 🚪💨  

---

## ✨ Why this exists
Because every student deserves to know:
- **How many classes can I bunk before 85%?** 🤔  
- **Am I safe if I skip tomorrow’s 8 AM?** 🛏️  
- **Do I have to run to college or can I chill?** ☕  

No more manual counting, no more panic. Just upload your attendance & timetable, and let AI + Supabase do the boring work.

## ⚡ What it does
- Upload screenshots → AI extracts attendance & timetable.  
- See your % and **bunk-safe buffer**.  
- Always know your status → *without Excel sheets, calculators, or stress*.

## 🛠️ Tech Magic
